Model is like a storage house , it can store resources to make creater take out when it is needed.
View's function is very like its name , its main function is to print results that creater coded from original code to the visional scene.
Controller, it is simliar to CPU, whatever you wanna do in rails ,you must take through by it ,so its crucial function is to call out the model and view .
